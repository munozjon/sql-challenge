## Module 9 Challenge

For this challenge, I was instructed to research the employees of fictional company Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. I was given 6 CSV files and was instructed to model, engineer, and analyze the data with SQL programming and a database diagram designer.

### Data Modeling

For the data modeling part of this challenge, I reviewed each CSV files to understand what kind of data existed in each table. These tables included employees, salaries, employee titles, departments, department employees, and department managers.
